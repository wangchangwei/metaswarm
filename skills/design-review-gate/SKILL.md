# Design Review Gate

## Purpose

This skill automatically activates after a design document is created (typically via `superpowers:brainstorming`). It ensures complex features receive proper review before implementation begins by spawning five specialist agents:

1. **Product Manager Agent** - Use case validation and user benefit review
2. **Architect Agent** - Technical architecture review
3. **Designer Agent** - UX/API design quality review
4. **Security Design Agent** - Security threat modeling and protection review
5. **CTO Agent** - Codebase alignment and TDD readiness review

All five must approve before proceeding to implementation.

---

## Coordination Mode Note

This skill supports both coordination modes:

- **Task Mode** (default): Spawn 5 parallel `Task()` subagents for each review round. Fresh instances per round.
- **Team Mode**: `TeamCreate("review-{design-doc-name}")`, spawn 5 reviewers as named teammates (`pm`, `architect`, `designer`, `security`, `cto`). Reviewers retain context through revision cycles — saves 5 cold starts per re-review round. After approval, send `shutdown_request` to all, then `TeamDelete`.

In either mode, the review criteria, iteration protocol, and escalation rules are identical. See `./guides/agent-coordination.md` for mode detection.

---

## Activation Triggers

This skill auto-activates when:

1. A design document is committed to `docs/plans/*-design.md`
2. The `superpowers:brainstorming` skill completes
3. User explicitly requests: `/review-design <path-to-design.md>`

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Spawn Review Agents (Parallel)

```typescript
// Spawn all five agents in parallel for efficiency
const [pmResult, architectResult, designerResult, securityResult, ctoResult] = await Promise.all([
  Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "PM review",
    prompt: pmReviewPrompt(designDocPath),
  }),
  Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Architect review",
    prompt: architectReviewPrompt(designDocPath),
  }),
  Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Designer review",
    prompt: designerReviewPrompt(designDocPath),
  }),
  Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Security design review",
    prompt: securityDesignReviewPrompt(designDocPath),
  }),
  Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "CTO review",
    prompt: ctoReviewPrompt(designDocPath),
  }),
]);
```

### Phase 2: Aggregate Results

Each agent returns a structured review:

```typescript
interface ReviewResult {
  agent: "product-manager" | "architect" | "designer" | "security-design" | "cto";
  verdict: "APPROVED" | "NEEDS_REVISION";
  blockers: string[]; // MUST fix before implementation
  suggestions: string[]; // Nice to have
  questions: string[]; // Clarifications needed
  use_case_analysis?: {
    // PM agent only
    total_use_cases: number;
    clear: number;
    needs_work: number;
    missing_scenarios: string[];
  };
  threat_model?: {
    // Security agent only
    high_risk: string[];
    medium_risk: string[];
    mitigations_required: string[];
  };
}
```

### Phase 3: Check Gate

```
IF all five agents return APPROVED:
  → Proceed to implementation
  → Create epic with approved design

ELSE:
  → Consolidate feedback
  → Present to user
  → Iterate on design
  → Re-run gate (max 3 iterations)
```

### Phase 4: Human Escalation

After 3 failed iterations:

1. Create summary of remaining blockers
2. Ask human to decide: override, defer, or cancel

## Iteration Protocol

### Round 1: Initial Review

1. Spawn all five agents in parallel
2. Wait for all results
3. If all APPROVED → proceed
4. If any NEEDS_REVISION → consolidate and present

### Rounds 2-3: Revision Cycles

1. Present consolidated feedback to human
2. Human revises design document
3. Re-run all five agents on updated doc
4. Repeat until all approve

### Round 4: Escalation

If still not approved after 3 iterations:

```markdown
## Design Review Gate: Escalation Required

After 3 review cycles, the following blockers remain unresolved:

### Architect Agent
- [blocker 1]
- [blocker 2]

### Designer Agent
- [blocker 1]

### CTO Agent
- [blocker 1]
- [blocker 2]

### Options
1. **Override** - Proceed anyway (document technical debt)
2. **Defer** - Shelve this feature for later
3. **Revise** - Continue iterating on design
4. **Cancel** - Abandon this feature

Please choose an option or provide additional context.

## Integration with Task Tracking

When design is approved:

#### 1. Land Document to Project Docs (for version control)

```bash
# Create versioned design document
mkdir -p docs/designs

# Determine version number (prompt user if not specified)
VERSION=${1:-"$(./scripts/next-version.sh minor)"}

# Write versioned design document
cat > "docs/designs/v${VERSION}-design.md" << 'DESIGN_EOF'
# Design Document — v{VERSION}
<!-- created: <timestamp> -->
<!-- design-review-gate: APPROVED -->
<!-- reviewers: PM, Architect, Designer, Security, CTO -->

<full approved design text>
DESIGN_EOF

echo "Design landed: docs/designs/v${VERSION}-design.md"
```

#### 2. Create Epic for Implementation

```bash
# Create epic linked to design doc
# Use your project's task tracking system to create an epic and implementation phase tasks
# Example:
# task-cli create "<feature-name>" --type epic
# task-cli create "Phase 1: Infrastructure" --type task --parent <epic-id>
# task-cli create "Phase 2: Backend" --type task --parent <epic-id>
# task-cli create "Phase 3: Frontend" --type task --parent <epic-id>
# task-cli create "Phase 4: Polish" --type task --parent <epic-id>
```

**Why this matters**: Landing to `docs/designs/` commits the design to version control so it survives beyond the session, is reviewable in future PRs, and provides an audit trail of approved designs.

## Output Format

### Approved Design

```markdown
## Design Review Gate: APPROVED

All five reviewers have approved the design.

| Agent           | Verdict  | Blockers | Suggestions |
| --------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Product Manager | APPROVED | 0        | 1           |
| Architect       | APPROVED | 0        | 2           |
| Designer        | APPROVED | 0        | 1           |
| Security Design | APPROVED | 0        | 2           |
| CTO             | APPROVED | 0        | 3           |

### Threat Model Summary (Security Agent)

- **High Risk**: None identified
- **Medium Risk**: AI-generated content could be manipulated
- **Mitigations**: Defense in depth already designed

### Suggestions (Non-Blocking)

1. [Architect] Consider adding caching layer for frequent queries
2. [Designer] Add loading skeleton to improve perceived performance
3. [Security] Add audit logging for all assistant actions
4. [Security] Consider anomaly detection for unusual query patterns
5. [CTO] Document rate limit headers in API response

### Next Steps

1. Create epic for implementation
2. Set up worktree with `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation

Ready to proceed with implementation? [Yes/No]
```

### Needs Revision

```markdown
## Design Review Gate: NEEDS REVISION

One or more reviewers found blocking issues.

| Agent           | Verdict        | Blockers | Suggestions |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Architect       | APPROVED       | 0        | 2           |
| Designer        | NEEDS_REVISION | 2        | 1           |
| Security Design | NEEDS_REVISION | 2        | 1           |
| CTO             | NEEDS_REVISION | 3        | 0           |

### Blocking Issues (MUST FIX)

#### Designer Agent

1. **Missing error states** - The design doesn't specify what happens when search returns 0 results
2. **Inconsistent API naming** - `get_contact_details` uses underscore but existing APIs use camelCase

#### Security Design Agent

1. **CRITICAL: userId trust boundary** - Design shows userId passed to tools, but userId MUST come from server session only. Model could be jailbroken to output arbitrary userIds.
2. **Missing rate limits** - AI endpoints are expensive and must have rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### CTO Agent

1. **Missing TDD specs** - No RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles documented
2. **Missing mock infrastructure** - No beforeEach/afterEach setup specified
3. **Missing edge cases** - Need systematic enumeration per method

### Threat Model (Security Agent)

- **High Risk**: User can potentially access other users' contacts via prompt injection
- **Medium Risk**: Rate limiting not defined for AI endpoints
- **Mitigations Required**: userId from session only, add rate limiting

### Questions Requiring Clarification

1. [CTO] What's the max conversation history size?
2. [Designer] What happens when user clicks "View More"?
3. [Security] How will location data be protected? Is it PII?

---

**Iteration**: 1 of 3
**Action Required**: Please revise the design document to address the blocking issues above.
